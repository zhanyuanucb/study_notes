## On the front
This is the note I wrote down while going through the note on [Binary Erasure Channel](./references/bec.pdf).  
I included the following in this note:  
- Background knowledge to briefly introduce the model of communication system designed by Shannon in 1940s.
- My paraphrase and visualization of the concept of *Capacity of a Channel.*
- A concrete example of Shannon's codebook, by which we can push the **rate** of a binary erasure channel(BEC) to its **capacity**.
- The formal definition of channal capacity and how to get the capacity of a BEC by this definition.

### Backgroud

### Channel Capacity

### The general result of channel capacity
