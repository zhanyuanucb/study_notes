- *Something interesting: In the second reference, someone mentioned Shannon's Theorem, which motivated me to review the Information Theory developed by Shannon in 1940s, even though it has nothing to do with this Leetcode problem. I left a note when I went through some notes on Information Theory, so check this out --> [channel_capacity and binary_erasure_channel](../stats-prob/channel_capacity_and_binary_erasure_channel.md)*
