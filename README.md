# My Study Notes

### Purpose of this repo: 
- The primary reason for writing down these notes is to improve my own pattern of learning in the sense of meta-learning.
- Also, this repo may be a baby attempt of my contribution to those research or learning communities in which I will be interested in the future.

### What's Meta Learing?
- Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized."

### What are in this repo?

- **leetcode:** Everything (like some concepts) that is worth bearing in mind behind those problems on Leetcode.

- **machine-learning:** Important concepts, tricks, or even visualization I find during my learning of Machine Learning

- **stats-prob:** Notes about Statistics and Probability

- **connections:** Notes on those inspiring connections of the three sessions above.

### TODO (2019/1/17):
- [ ] Review the notes of info theory and BEC
- [ ] Finish the first note, which is about the connection between the "single number" question on Leetcode and Information theory.
- [ ] Finish the second note, which is about the backprop in an RNN.
