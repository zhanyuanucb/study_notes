# My Study Notes

### Purpose of this repo: 
- The primary reason for writing down these notes is to improve my own pattern of learning in the sense of meta-learning.
- Also, this repo may be a baby attempt of my contribution to those research or learning communities in which I will be interested in the future.

### What's Meta Learing?
- Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized."
